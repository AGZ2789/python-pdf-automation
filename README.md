# PDF Automation with Python

This is a small learning project demonstrating how to **extract text from PDFs** and **generate new PDFs** using Python.  
It uses two popular libraries:
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) for reading and extracting text
- [fpdf2](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf2/) for creating PDFs
